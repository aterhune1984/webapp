notes:

minikube service webapp --url

About:

This is a simple website that kicks off scripts (placed in ./app/subjob/) and runs those scripts on
celery workers while sending output back to the web browser in real time using websockets

This is intended to be deployed in kubernetes
Github workflows are as follows:

Terraform EKS cluster manually built / destroyed

Any code changes  > docker-build.yml
# it builds a new image and tells you the image name, so you
# can update the k8s deployment with the necessary info

k8s directory changes > push-code.yml
# does kubectl apply to the k8s directory and tells you the Url that the tool is using.
